LocationCopyHook
================

The location copy hook is defined in zope.location but only activated if this
package is installed.

It's job is to allow copying referenced objects that are not located inside
object that's being copied.

To see the problem, imagine we want to copy an ILocation object that
contains an attribute-based reference to another ILocation object
and the referenced object is not contained inside object being copied. 

Without this hook, the referenced object will be cloned:

  >>> from zope.location.location import Location, locate
  >>> root = Location()
  >>> page = Location()
  >>> locate(page, root, 'page')
  >>> image = Location()
  >>> locate(page, root, 'image')
  >>> page.thumbnail = image

  >>> from zope.copy import copy
  >>> page_copy = copy(page)
  >>> page_copy.thumbnail is image
  False

But if we will provide a hook, the attribute will point to the
original object as we might want.

  >>> from zope.component import provideAdapter
  >>> from zope.location.pickling import LocationCopyHook
  >>> from zope.location.interfaces import ILocation
  >>> provideAdapter(LocationCopyHook, (ILocation,))

  >>> from zope.copy import copy
  >>> page_copy = copy(page)
  >>> page_copy.thumbnail is image
  True
